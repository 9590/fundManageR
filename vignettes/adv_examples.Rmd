This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Demonstrating some of [fundManageR](https://github.com/abresler/fundManageR)'s [ADV](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advform.asp) data acquisition functions.


## Setup

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
packages <- c('fundManageR', 'dplyr', 'tidyr', 'purrr', 'formattable', 'stringr')
lapply(packages, library, character.only = T)
```

### Explore the most rececent ADV summary data.
Here will use the `get_data_adv_managers_current_period_summary` function to do some quick explorations of ADV filing investment managers.


```{r most_recent}
most_recent_data <- 
  get_data_adv_managers_current_period_summary(file_directory = 'Desktop/adv_test')

```

#### Explore the top 5 managers by AUM 

```{r top_5_table}
most_recent_data %>% 
  head %>% 
  formattable()
```

#### Which states have the highest concentration of investment managers?

```{r recent_summary_state}
most_recent_data %>%
  group_by(stateOfficePrimary) %>%
  summarise(
  amountAUMTotal = sum(amountAUMTotal, na.rm = T) %>% currency(digits = 0),
  countEmployeesTotal = sum(countEmployeesTotal, na.rm = T) %>% comma(digits = 0),
  countCompanies = n() %>% comma(digits = 0)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  arrange(desc(amountAUMTotal)) %>% 
  formattable()

```

### Lets use this data to find out detailed information to explore about an investment manager

For this example we will try to find out information about entities related to [The Blackstone Group](), we can expand this search for entities that MAY be related to Blackstone by taking advantage of the fact we know Blackstone's office is located at 345 Park Avenue in New York.

```{r search_for_bx}
possible_bx_companies <- 
  most_recent_data %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    nameEntityManager %>% str_detect("BLACKSTONE REAL|BREP|GSO") |
      locationOfficePrimary %>% str_detect("^345 PARK AVENUE") |
      urlManager %>% str_detect('blackstone.com')
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(
    idCRD,
    nameEntityManager,
    urlManager,
    locationOfficePrimary,
    urlManager,
    amountAUMTotal
  )

```

```{r possible_bx_table}
possible_bx_companies %>% 
  formattable()
```

Some of these entities we know are not related to Blackstone so let's exclude them, others have no stated AUM so we can exclude those as well.

```{r possible_bx}
possible_bx_companies <- 
  possible_bx_companies %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!nameEntityManager %>% str_detect('LADDER CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC|DEUTSCHE|DBX|WAFRA|DB ')) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(amountAUMTotal > 0)

```

```{r bx_table}
possible_bx_companies %>% 
  formattable()
```

### Detailed ADV Function Exploration

#### Brochure D ata
Before diving into how to use these functions lets whittle down our data to a vector of CRDs we can feed into our functions.

```{r bx_crds}
blackstone_crds <- 
  possible_bx_companies$idCRD
```

Now that we have this let's pull in all the manager brochure data.  That will allow us to perform all sorts of interesting types NLP, sentiment, and text analysis.

```{r bx_brochure_search}
blackstone_brochure_data <- 
  get_data_adv_managers_brochures(search_names = NULL, crd_ids = blackstone_crds, split_pages = T)

```

#### Entity Resolution Example

If you look at the table from before there is one name that sticks out as a possible difficult to resolve possible Blackstone entity, `CT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO., LLC`.  There a bunch of ways to try to resolve this possible relationship; `fundManageR` affords us a bunch of possible data driven ways to do this.  

One cool feature of the [pdftools](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools) package is we can extract a PDF file's metadata, this package takes advantage of that functionality.  In this example we will take advantage of the PDF file's author metadata to see if the author of CT Investment Management's filing appears in any the entities we know with absolute certainty are Blackstone entities.

```{r ct_author}
ct_validation_test <- 
  blackstone_brochure_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(idCRD, nameEntityManager, nameAuthor) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  dplyr::filter(nameAuthor %>% str_detect('buergerm'))
```

```{r capital_trust_validation}
ct_validation_test %>% 
  format_table()
```

Well well well, looks like `buergerm` *has* authored some of the PDFs that we KNOW are related to Blackstone, there for it is safe to say CT Investment Management is indeed a related party to Blackstone. Entity resolved!

#### Text Analysis Example -- Extracting Fund Management Fee Tiers

Next let's see if we can try to figure out the tier's of management fees Blackstone charges its investors.  To do this you will need the fantastic [tidytext](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) package developed by [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob).  If you don't have the package you can install it from CRAN or via github.

The first step to achieving our stated goal is to tokenize each brochure's sentences.  We want to to try to determine whether a stated sentence may contain a reference to a management fee.  We can use that using `stringr` and it's `str_detect` function with a list of management fee hit words, the most important of which being a % sign.  Once completed we will take those sentence, tokenize down to words and look for a number less than 5 knowing management fees are generally between 1% and 5%.  After we do that we can look at identified sentences and see how we did!

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidytext) ## devtools::install_github(juliasilge/tidytext)
```

##### Tokenize and Parse Brochure Data

```{r tokenize}
sentence_data <-
  blackstone_brochure_data %>%
  dplyr::select(idCRD, nameEntityManager, textBrochure) %>%
  unnest_tokens(sentence, textBrochure, token = "sentences") %>%
  mutate(idSentence = 1:n()) %>% 
  mutate(
    hasMGMTFeeReference = sentence %>% str_detect('[1-99]%')
  )

possible_fees <- 
  sentence_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(hasMGMTFeeReference == T) %>% 
  dplyr::select(idCRD, nameEntityManager, sentence, idSentence) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, sentence, token = 'words') %>% 
  dplyr::filter(word %>% str_detect("^[1-9]")) %>% 
  mutate(word = word %>% as.numeric) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(word <= 5)
```

```{r possible_fee_locations}
possible_fees %>% 
  formattable
```

#### Test our accuracy by printing these sentences.

```{r fee_results}
possible_fees$idSentence %>%
  unique() %>%
  map_chr(function(x) {
    setence_df <- 
      sentence_data %>%
      dplyr::filter(idSentence == x) 
    fee_text <-
      setence_df %>%
      .$sentence %>% paste0('\n', ., '\n')
    setence_df$nameEntityManager %>% paste0('Manager: ',., '\n', fee_text) 
  }) %>% 
  paste0(collapse = '\n') %>% 
  message
```

This incredibly basic workflow looks like it produced a solid method for identifying and potentially extracting those management fees!  There is so much more we could do with this, some of which I will explore in a [blog post]() in the near future but from here let's dig a little bit deeper into each of this entities using `fundManageR's` `get_data_adv_managers_filings` function.

#### Digging into an SEC Regulated Manager.
The most difficult feature to build was `fundManageR` to parse the SEC's absolutely HORRENDUS online ADV forms.  Fortunately this task, though extremely difficult, was doable.  Parsing an ADV form, especially if you select a manager with a large amount of assets under management can be a little time consuming considering the size of the data being processed so please, be patient.

Instead of selecting all possible sections you can specify the specific sections you want the function to pull in, to see your options you can call the `get_data_sec_adv_manager_sitemap` function.
```{r adv_site_map}
get_data_sec_adv_manager_sitemap() %>% 
  formattable()
```


In our Blackstone example the majority of our selected entities have billions of dollars in assets under management so acquiring data for every section and each entity will take some time, you can follow the functions progress in the messages.  The `get_data_adv_managers_filings` returns a list of nested data frames by entity manager and section; to make the data easier to explore upon scraping the default action is to save each section into the user's environment and we combine the brochure sections with a unique list of values describing the manager into a single data frame assigned to the environment as `managerDescription`, you can override this by setting flatten_tables to `FALSE`.

```{r manager_detail_search}
blackstone_entity_df <- 
  get_data_adv_managers_filings(
    search_names = NULL,
    crd_ids = blackstone_crds,
    all_sections = T,
    assign_to_enviornment = T
  )
```

### Explore the Results

#### Manager Description
Contains general information about the manager from all sections with distinct data.

```{r manager_description}
managerDescription 
```

#### DRPs and Regulatory CRD Infractions
Contains information about any violations by the manager or it's employees.  These includes any violation levied by a government or self-policing regulatory body.

```{r drps}
managerRegulatoryCRD
```

#### Record Locations
This section discloses the where the manager stores its books and records.

```{r records}
managerRecordLocations

```

#### Other disclosures
This section discloses any other relevant information the manager wishes to communicate to the SEC including certain details regarding data in the filing.

```{r other_disclosures}
managerOtherDisclosures
```

#### Private Fund Reporting
This section includes information about the underlying fund vehicles of a registered manager.  This may include information about the fund size, number of investors, types of investors, distribution of ownership, details about third parties that service the fund [accountants, marketing agents, custodians, prime brokers, etc..] and any information about related parties to the fund [General Partner, Managing Member, etc..]

```{r private_funds}
section7BPrivateFundReporting
```

The private fund section is chocked full of great visualizable data, and to demonstrate we are going to crate a [treemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping) visualization care of [Kenton Russell's](https://twitter.com/timelyportfolio) fantastic [d3treeR](https://twitter.com/timelyportfolio) package that will explore Blackstone's assets under management by fund type, fund manager, fund vehicle name, and number of fund investors.

```{r bx_treemap}
library(treemap) # install.packages('treemap')
library(d3treeR) # devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/d3treeR")
section7BPrivateFundReporting %>% 
  mutate(nameFund = nameFund %>% str_replace_all('\\ ','\n')) %>% 
  treemap(
    index = c("typeFund",'nameEntityManager', "nameFund"),
    vSize = "amountFundGrossAUM",
    vColor = "countFundOwners",
    palette = "RdYlGn", 
    fontsize.labels = 8,
    type = "value"
  ) %>% 
  d3tree2(rootname = "Blackstone Vehicles")
```

### Schedule A - Direct Owners
This section includes information about the individuals and entities that own the registering entity, this includes ranged disclosures on percentage of ownership.  This information, along with Schedule B, are ideal uses for [Network Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory).  We will even demonstrate a really quick and dirty network graph using [Rich Iannone's](https://twitter.com/riannone) [DiagrammeR](https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR) package.
```{r schedule_a}
sectionScheduleA # Direct Owners
```


```{r network_graph, fig.width=6}
library(DiagrammeR) # install.packages("DiagrammeR")
schedule_a <-
  sectionScheduleA %>%
  mutate_at(
    .cols = c('nameEntityManager', 'nameCommonEntityOwnerManager'),
    funs(. %>% str_replace_all('\\ ', '\n'))
  )
funds <- 
  schedule_a %>% dplyr::select(nameEntityManager) %>% distinct %>% data.frame
entities <- 
  schedule_a %>% dplyr::select(nameCommonEntityOwnerManager) %>% distinct %>% data.frame

create_graph() %>%
  set_graph_name("blackstone_owners") %>%
  set_global_graph_attrs(
    "graph", "output", "visNetwork") %>%
  add_nodes_from_table(
    funds,
    set_type = "fund",
    label_col = "nameEntityManager") %>% 
  add_nodes_from_table(
    entities,
    set_type = "person",
    label_col = "nameCommonEntityOwnerManager") %>% 
  add_edges_from_table(
    schedule_a %>% data.frame,
    from_col = "nameEntityManager",
    from_mapping = "nameEntityManager",
    to_col = "nameCommonEntityOwnerManager",
    to_mapping = "nameCommonEntityOwnerManager"
  ) %>%
  visnetwork()
```

### Schedule B - Indirect Owners
This section includes information on the owners of any Schedule A owner that is an entity
```{r schedule_b}
sectionScheduleB # Indirect Owners
```

### Related Advisors

```{r realted_advisers}
managerRelatedAdvisers
```

### Other Office Locations
This section includes information on all secondary offices, when applicable, related to the filing manager.

```{r other_offices}
managerOtherOfficeLocations
```


### Control Entities

```{r control_publics}
managerControlPublicEntities
```


### Control Persons
